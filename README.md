# FitNesse Html Util

This repository contains the `HtmlUtil` class from Robert C. Martin's Clean Code handbook (p. 32) or rather
from [FitNesse](https://github.com/unclebob/fitnesse/).

We use this project as a starting point for a fist simple refactoring task on function-level.

## Task

1. Create a fork of this repository
2. Try to understand the `HtmlUtil` class and its test class
3. Refactor the `HtmlUtil` class to the best of your belief
4. Create a pull request to submit you proposals

## How to build and run the FitNesse Html Util
You can choose to use either Java or Python.
